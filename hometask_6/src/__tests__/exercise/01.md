When it comes to React components, our developer user will render our component
with `ReactDOM` (similar concept for React Native) and in some cases they'll
pass props and/or wrap it in a context provider. The end user will click buttons
and assert on the output.
So that's what our test will do.
ðŸ“œ You'll be using assertions from jest: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect

## Exercise

We have a simple counter component (if you have the app running locally, you can
interact with it at: http://localhost:3000/counter). Your job is to make sure
that it starts out saying "Current count: 0" and that when the user clicks
"Increment" it'll increase the count and when they click "Decrement" it'll
decrease the count.

To do this, you'll need to create a DOM node, add it to the body, and render the
component to that DOM node. You'll also need to clean up the DOM when your test
is finished so the next test has a clean DOM to interact with.
