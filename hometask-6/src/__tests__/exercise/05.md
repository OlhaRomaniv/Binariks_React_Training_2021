# testing custom hooks

## Exercise

In this exercise, we have gone back to our simple counter, except now that logic
is all in a custom hook and we need to test that functionality. To do that,
we'll make a test component that uses the hook in the typical way that our hook
will be used and then test that component, indirectly testing our hook.
