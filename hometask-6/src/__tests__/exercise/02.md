# Simple test with React Testing Library

## Background

Here's a simple example of how to use React Testing Library:

```javascript
import {render, fireEvent, screen} from '@testing-library/react'

test('it works', () => {
  const {container} = render(<Example />)
  // container is the div that your component has been mounted onto.

  const input = container.querySelector('input')
  fireEvent.mouseEnter(input) // fires a mouseEnter event on the input

  screen.debug() // logs the current state of the DOM (with syntax highlighting!)
})
```

Notice the lack of `cleanup` functionality. That's thanks to
`@testing-library/react`'s
[auto-cleanup feature](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/api#cleanup).

Another automatic feature of React Testing Library is its handling of
[React's `act` function](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html#act). 

## Exercise

In this exercise, we're going to remove some of our boilerplate that React
Testing Library does for us.


## Extra Credit

### 1. ðŸ’¯ use @testing-library/jest-dom

Testing Library also has a suite of assertions that can be installed with Jest.
They're already added to this project, so you can switch from Jest's built-in
assertions to more specific assertions which will give you better error
messages. So go ahead and swap the `expect(message.textContent).toBe(...)`
assertions with `toHaveTextContent` from
[`@testing-library/jest-dom`](http://testing-library.com/jest-dom).
