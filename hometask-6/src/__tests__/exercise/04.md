# Form testing

## Background

Our users spend a lot of time interacting with forms and many of our forms are
among the most important parts of our application (like the "checkout" form of
an e-commerce app or the "login" form of most apps). Because of this, it's
pretty critical to have confidence that those continue to work over time.

You need to ensure that the user can find inputs in the form, fill in their
information, and validate that when they submit the form the submitted data is
correct.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we'll be testing a Login form that has a username and
password. The Login form accepts an `onSubmit` handler which will be called with
the form data when the user submits the form. Your job is to write a test for
this form.

Make sure to keep your test implementation detail free and refactor friendly!

## Extra Credit

### 1. ðŸ’¯ use a jest mock function

Jest has built-in "mock" function APIs. Rather than creating the `submittedData`
variable, try to use a mock function and assert it was called correctly:

- ðŸ“œ `jest.fn()`: https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api
- ðŸ“œ `toHaveBeenCalledWith`:
  https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tohavebeencalledwitharg1-arg2-
